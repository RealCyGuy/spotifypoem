A spotless bedroom, spends quiet nights
Pilates mornings and she's good with wine
She wakes at the right time, sets the right vibes
She's funny but never too much
Mysterious but always in touch
I wonder what you see when you see someone like me
Do you see her?
Won't you rather touch marble instead of limestone?
All I wish to be is someone deserving
Of the comfort that you bring
'Cause deep inside, I wanna be her
She takes the hit but never shows you where it hurts
Bathes you in spring sunshine
Wipes tears dry and says I love you twice
Seasons change say youâ€™ll stay the same
Through spring, fall, and winter
Look my way, look your way
Say okay, I'm okay
So that even through the snow, you can forever be in bloom
In seven years time, will I look back and wonder?
Why was I such a mess? Unable to relax
Got me on edge everyday
Acting chill on stage but melting down when I'm off it
And in secret, I struggle to put on my best for the red carpet
I know I laugh it off but my words are genuine
Your reflection in the mirror is a masterpiece portrait
Know you're tired of me saying it but I'm still scared you'll leave
No matter what you see, can your eyes please stay on me?
Even when I dullen with time, please tell me I still shine
'Cause deep inside, I wanna be her
She takes the hit but swings back stronger than before
Bathes you in spring sunshine
Wipes tears dry and says I love you twice
Seasons change, say you'll stay the same
'Cause I love you
Look my way, look your way, say okay, I'm okay
Oh, to be everblooming with you
I'll say I love you twice
